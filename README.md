# Antarctica's contribution to long-term future sea level rise

Antarctica is the largest potential contributor to sea level rise, but is also the most uncertain. My PhD uses the BISICLES ice sheet model to investigate sources of uncertainty in Antarctica's response to climate change.

BISICLES is ran on the [ARCHER2](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/) high performance computer. Scripts for running BISICLES and processing the outputs can be found in the repo [hpc](https://github.com/Jonniebarnsley/hpc). Subsequent data analysis is done locally and recorded here. Summary data from the ensembles can be found in `data`; the full dataset is available upon request. Please contact jonathan.barnsley@kcl.ac.uk for more details.
